Hobby project used to learn different programming languanges by implementing websocket tunnel server/client
 
websocket tunnel is the most important thing I used everyday. 
Not only for creating a self-owned intranet for self-hosted services, but also get the freedom from passing through NAT of my company

Previously, I just relied on existing websocket tunnel tool
An idea to implement self-owned version for both better self-studying and not be stocked by the update status of existing tools
